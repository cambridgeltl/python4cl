Sentiment is an opinion or emotion (usually positive or negative) that is reflected in a sequence of words. And analysis? Well, this is the process of looking at data and making inferences about the sentiment; in our case, we will use machine learning to learn and predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.\n",
