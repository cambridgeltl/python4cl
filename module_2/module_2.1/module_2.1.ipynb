    "  <p>The correct answer is B - Naive Bayes assumes that the probability of finding a certain word is independent from the probability of finding another word. So, for example, in the domain of movie reviews, it assumes that the probabilities of finding the words <code>Indiana</code> and <code>Jones</code> are not correlated, even if in practice we know that this is not the case.</p>\n",

We will use it to classify some toy examples, and then we will turn to Sentiment Analysis, by training our simple model on a research dataset.

    "While the latter may not sound like a big issue for you, unfortunately dealing with very small numbers may be problematic for a computer - as mentioned in Module 1.2, computers use [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic), which in practice means that they aren't actually very good at dealing with very small or very big numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "When developing machine learning models, a common problem is to tune your algorithm too heavily to perform well on a specific set of data; this problem is called **overfitting**. This happens because the model tries too hard to obtain good performance on a specific subset of your data, so it is not able to **generalise** well anymore on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are using a training set and a test set. Even if we tune our Naive Bayes implementation very well on our test set, we have no clue on how it would perform on new, unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several solutions to this problem; with neural networks, a typical solution is to have three sets: a training, development (or validation), and training set; we train on the training set, trying to obtain the best performance on the development set. When we are satisfied with the performance of our algorithm on the dev set, we run our model on the yet-unseen test set; since we never ran our model on this set, we will have a good idea on its ability to generalise on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not always feasible. If you don't have enough data, for example, an alternative is to use **cross-validation**. In cross-validation, you divide your corpus in a $k$ subsets, called *folds*; then, for each of the $k$ folds, we:\n",

This technique is called $k$-fold cross-validation, and it's helpful to verify that our model is able to perform well on different training/test splits, without relying to much on an arbitrary train/test split which may result in an abnormally good (or bad) model just because of chance.\n",
